synopsis: "The solver for the Touist language"
description: """

Touist is the compiler for the TouIST language. The TouIST language offers a
friendly syntax for writing propositional logic (SAT), logic on real and
integers (SMT) and quantified boolean formulas (QBF). This language aims to
formalize real-life problems (e.g., the sudoku can be solved in a few
lines). Touist embeds a SAT solver (minisat) and can be built with
optionnal SMT and QBF solvers. Touist is also able to generate the latex,
DIMACS, SMT-LIB and QDIMACS formats from a touist file.

Optionnal solvers:
- for using Yices2 (--smt --solve), run `opam install yices2`
- for using Quantor (--qbf --solve), run `opam install qbf`
