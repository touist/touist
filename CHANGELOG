v2.1.4
  - gui:
    - when clicking on the Solve button, it turns into 'Translating' as long
      as `touistc` is translating, and then 'Solving' when the SAT solver is
      running. Also removed the alert message when stopping the solver.
v2.1.3
  - gui:
    - fixed a bug in the latex viwer that was removing the carriage return
      when a line was beginning with a '('.
    - ctrl+left and ctrl+right are now working properly for moving
      word by word in the text editor on Windows
v2.1.2
  - touistc:
    - abs() is now supported (absolute value)
v2.1.1
  - gui:
    - fixed a bug that was preventing from ./external/touistc to be run when
      the path contains whitespaces
v2.1.0
  - gui: 
    - semantic errors (that only appear when pressing 'Solve' are now
      displayed) are now displayed like the syntaxic errors (still after
      'Solve')
  - touistc:
    - it is now possible to do the affectations before the formulas, with
      no separator between sets and formulas. It is still possible to affect
      after formulas with the separation keyword 'data'. You can only affect
      before or after, not both.
    - semantic errors (e.g., variables with wrong type) are now giving
      a location (line, column). Some errors still lack the location but 99%
      of them are covered.
    - (internal) revamped the grammar specification to make it clear. The
      'simple' and 'smt-augmented' grammars are now well separated.
      Many error messages have been re-worked; among them, suggestions of
      operators when an expression continuation is expected.
      The number of messages goes from 89 to 144.
    - merged 'term' and 'tuple-term' into one single concept: the proposition.
      A proposition can be either 'abcd' or 'abcd(1,cd,56,$i)'.
v2.0.1
  - gui:
    - fixed crash when touist.jar was opened from inside the zip archive
  - touistc:
    - when dimacs and table both printing on stdout, the table now
      begins with 'c' to be able to pipe directly to a solver
    - added possibility of using a term in a 'when' or 'if' statement, e.g.,
      'bigand $i in [a,b,c] when $i != a: p($i) end
v2.0.0
  - touistc:
    - simplified 'begin sets end sets begin formula end formula'; syntax is
        <formulas> data <sets>
      Note that the sets are now after formulas. It will be soon possible
      to give the formulas and sets as two separate files, for genericity
      of the models (defined by the formulas) and the data (the sets).
   - fixed the problem of "Clause is always true/false" when bigand or
     bigor does not produce anything
   - added --linter for syntax errors and --linter-expand for syntax+
     semantic errors. The first is fast, the second is a bit slower.
   - added --verbose to have a sense of what is happening when the
     compiler is taking a long time to anwser.
  - gui:
    - now shows the errors in the editor we red-underlyings; you can
      see the error hovering the mouse over the error.
    - merged the sets and formulas tabs in GUI; the solution is now to
      use the syntax <formulas> data <sets>. I'm still looking for
      a way to separate formulas and sets in GUI, e.g., two separate
      files that have each its own tab
    - matching parenthesis are now hightlighted
    - when error message is too large, added 'click to view' message
    - linux: "solve" now works properly when touist.jar is opened by
      icon-clicking
v1.4.2
    - (regression) possible to declare a set with terms: [a,b,c]...
v1.4.1
    - (regression) output of the table (id,name) had been inverted (!)
v1.4.0
  - touistc:
    - touistc is now able to solve SAT problems on its own. You can use
      '--solve' to return the first model of your problem, '--count' for
      counting the number of models), '--limit i' for setting a limit to
      the number of models returned (or 0 for no limit). Way faster that
      the java call to minisat.jar!
    - Added --equiv that allows to test the equivalency of two files.
      Note that it is not an actual equivalence as both problems must 
      have the exact same set of propositions/literals.
    - (internal) merged exp and clause types for less code redundancy
    - added support for local variables of the form 'let $i=1: p($i)'.
      A 'let' variable is local to the clause it precedes, e.g., p($i) 
  - gui:
    - added support for local variables of the form
      'let $i=1: p($i) end'. For now, the scope of these variables is
      not actually limited to the current context (the current clause);
      the variables exist even after 'end'.
v1.3.1
  - touistc:
    - fixed `a (b)` recognized as `a(b)` instead of `a and b`
    - added --debug-formula-expansion which prints the "expanded" version
      of bigand, bigor, exact and numerical expressions; helps for debugging
      complex formulas!
  - gui:
    - select the system language automatically
    - fix "export" button not working
    - export and import are now use the operating system UI (jre>=1.7)
    - jre>=1.7 is now required; it solves the wierd mac problem that says
      that you need to install the JDK for using command-line functions
v1.3.0
  - touist.jar:
    - fix touist hanging on "solve" on some unsatisfiable formulas
    - fix subset(.,.) construct not displayed in latex display
  - touistc:
    - now possible to have empty sets or formula block
    - added message when using a undeclared $var
    - added message when using a set instead of a term
    - added message when using a variable that doesn't have
      the expected content
    - revamped syntax errors, with multi-lines errors and precise position
      Note that many syntax errors still lack a proper message; some error
      messages still you can help us improve these messages in
      parser.messages file.
    - added <=> symbol that had been forgotten at some point
    - fixed bug with `not((p => p) => (q => q))` that should be
      unsat; it was related to CNF expansion happening in inner -> outer
      instead of outer -> inner
    - added --debug-cnf option for debugging cnf.ml transformations
    - added --debug-syntax option for debugging parser.messages messages
v1.2.0
  - touistc: select stdin with "-" and default output to stdout
  - touistc: fixed bugs when translating to CNF; now handles correctly
    forms like `((p => q) and (q => r)) => r` and cleaned code.
v1.1.4
  - fixed bug on expressions like (a=>b)=>c
v1.1.3
  - added "View" menu item with zoom/unzoom latex viewer
  - ctrl-related shortcuts will now work with cmd on osx 

v1.1.2 (2016/04/03)
  - fix problem with whitespaces in path names (Victor David)
  - touistc: In SMT mode, "Float" was produced instead of "Real" (Frédéric Maris)
  - touistc: Now display a proper error when -smt2 is given with no logic    (Maël Valais)
  - gui: the left "snippets" panel has now a correct size (Maël Valais)
  - gui: more explicit error message when touistc is missing (Maël Valais)

v1.1.1
  - gui: dollars in variables are now displaying in bold font in latex (Maël Valais)
  - touistc: the left panel with formulas should now be wide enough (Maël Valais)
  - gui: the _ characters won't trigger anymore small indices in latex (Maël Valais)
  - touistc: fixed the exception given by touistc when a variable has not been declared (Maël Valais)
  - workflow: added AppVeyor for the windows continuous integration (Maël Valais)

v1.0.0
  - No entries before that version
