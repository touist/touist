v3.5.3
  - Command-line
    - added --latex=katex. As Katex does not support \substack{}, it uses
      \begin{matrix} instead.
    - fixed a bug that was making --limit=0 display only the first model
      instead of all models (reported by Igor Stéphan).
v3.5.2 (2018-03-12)
  - Language:
    - added list comprehensions (also named 'set builder notation'). Really
      useful for generating sets! Example: [p($i,$j) for $i,$j in [1..2],[a,b]].
  - Command-line
    - it is now possible to display elapsed time (translation time and solve
      time) in --solve and --solver modes. To enable it, use -v/--verbose.
v3.5.1 (2018-01-07)
  - GUI (fixes):
    - fixed wrong line numbers displayed in error messages in QBF and SMT modes
  - Language:
    - sets and variables (and any other expression) can now be a formula;
      in order for these formulas not be evaluated as a normal boolean
      expression, they must be double quoted (e.g., "a and b => c").
  - Command-line
    - the --verbose flag now takes a number (1 for the lightest verbosity,
      2 and more for more verbosity).
    - with --solver, in order to show stdin/stdout/stderr you now have
      to use -v2 (or --verbose=2). -v only shows the count of literals/clauses.
    - fixed the empty enviroment that was given to the --solver command. Now,
      the solver command is launched using the same env as its parent.
v3.5.0 (2017-11-28)
  - Command-line
    - touist finally has a proper man page. To open it, use `touist --help'
      or `man touist'.
    - you can now pass arguemnts both using `--flag PARAM' or `--flag=PARAM'.
    - (BREAKING) `--smt' can be used without a logic; by default, QF_LRA is used.
    - (BREAKING) `--debug' renamed to `--verbose'
    - (BREAKING) removed `--debug-cnf' (replaced by `--show=cnf')
    - (BREAKING) removed `--debug-syntax' (replaced by `--verbose')
    - (BREAKING) removed `--latex-full (replaced by `--latex=document)
    - `--show' now takes an optional parameter (can be form, cnf, prenex).
      `--show' keeps the same behaviour but `--debug-cnf' is now `--show=cnf'.
    - `--latex' now takes an optional argument (mathjax or document).
      `--latex' stays the same and refers to `--latex=mathjax', `--latex-full'
      is removed and becomes `--latex=document'.
  - API
    - (BREAKING) Modules renamed (again, sorry!) from `TouistParse'
      to `Touist.Parse'. Function 'SatSolve.Model.pprint' takes 'table' as first
      argument.
    - (internal) use jbuilder instead of oasis, cmdliner instead of Arg.Parse.
v3.4.4 (2017-11-14)
  - Command-line
    - fix (AGAIN) the --solver option; when parsing the integers of the model,
      it was accepting non-model lines. I hope that will be enough...
v3.4.3 (2017-11-13)
  - Command-line
    - fix the option --solver with --sat solvers, once for all.
    - option --solver now supports Minisat output.
v3.4.2 (2017-11-12)
  - Command-line (new features)
    - the option '--solver CMD' can be used with --debug in order to display
      the stdin, stdout and stderr w.r.t. the external solver.
  - Command-line (fixes)
    - the option '--solver CMD' now uses the same error codes as with
      '--solve'; it expects the external solver to return 10 for SAT and
      20 for UNSAT (as most minisat-inspired solvers do).
    - in --sat mode, the option '--solver CMD' will now work properly instead
      of throwing "assert raised in src/Minisat.ml".
v3.4.1 (2017-11-05)
  - Command-line (new features)
    - added option '--solver CMD'; combined with --sat or --qbf, touist
      will run CMD feeding the (Q)DIMACS into stdin and expecting a
      DIMACS on stdout; it then prints the model as usual.
    - with --latex, fixed 'subset' that was translated into \subset instead
      of \subseteq.
    - (internal) drop the 'fileutils' dependency as it was not used anyway.
v3.4.0 (2017-09-13)
  - TouIST language:
    - 'inter', 'union', 'diff' and 'subset' are now infix operators;
      the prefix versions are still available (but they produce a warning).
  - API:
    - when touist is installed through opam ('opam install touist'), you can
      use it as a library. The API reference is now published on the website.
  - GUI (new features):
    - added the menu button 'Log' that allows to monitor what is happening
      under the hood.
    - the look of the main window has been (kind of) improved with
      less useless blank spaces. Also, the window can be resized smaller
      than before.
    - in the result view, you can now hide all valuations that
      are not true or false. For example, it allows us to hide all
      undefined valuations (denoted by '?') that clutter the results.
    - on macOS, a native application is now available; on Windows, a .exe
      is available (instead of clicking on the .jar). On Linux, a simple
      script launches the jar.
    - 'save' and 'open' now remember the last file opened; the current
      file is displayed in the window title. Also, a friendly warning is now
      displayed when opening or quitting while the current file is unsaved.
    - drag-and-drop enabled on macOS in native TouIST.app (dropping on
      the dock or in the app) and on Windows native TouIST.exe.
    - added links to the manual in 'Help' menu
  - GUI (fixes)
    - fixed 'inter', 'union' and 'subset' that were not properly colored
    - fixed the extremely slow/laggy scrolling of the latex right-panel when
      using the mouse wheel.
    - fixed the 'Solve' button hanging indefinitely in QBF mode
    - fixed the filtering (regex or true/false) of the results on SMT
      and QBF modes.
    - fixed a bug that was preventing the user from filtering when a
      single result was returned.
  - Command-line (new features):
    - in --sat mode, the new option --interactive will enable the
      display of one model at a time by pressing any key (q/n to stop).
    - it is now possible to output QDIMACS using --qbf
    - added --debug-dimacs which displays names instead of numbers in
      DIMACS (--sat) and QDIMACS (--qbf).
  - Command-line (fixes):
    - fixed a bug with --sat --solve where touist was giving a model
      although the formula is UNSAT (it was caused by a misuse of minisat).
    - fixed --latex that failing without --linter
    - (BREAKING) We had not correctly followed the DIMACS specification:
      any comments had to appear before the preamble 'p cnf 4 7'.
      Now, the mapping table (between propositions names and numbers)
      will be given before anything else (with flags --qbf or --sat).
v3.2.3 (2017-09-05)
  - added an option (--debug) which enable the display of stacktrace
    on exception catched on exit
  - vars indices '$var(1,2)' are now printed as indices in latex
v3.2.2 (2017-07-07)
  - fixed `card()` that was expecting two closing parenthesis instead of one
  - the 'let' construct can now handle multiple variables separated with ','
  - interface: ctrl+s is now remembering the file you opened/saved
v3.2.1 (2017-06-23)
  - added the '--latex-full' option. It does the same as '--latex' except that
    multi-line spanning parenthesis are translated with 'pmatrix' and a header
    and footer are added to make the output direclty compatible with pdflatex.
  - (breaking) With --sat --solve which by default only returns one model,
    touist now omits the ==== lines (which are useless for one model).
    This change also allows us to have a unified --solve experience, as
    the --smt and --qbf solvers also return the first model.
  - the 'let' statement can now be used with a list of vars/values. For
    example: let $i,$j = 1,2: p($i,$j)

v3.2.0 (2017-06-13)
  - (breaking) removed '--detailed' that wasn't really helpful to
    '--error-format' that allows to use placeholders (%l for line, %c for
    column...) to customize how errors should display.
  - (breaking) error messages are now using a more informative layout:
        filename: line 9, col 67-80: error: the error message
  - added the argument --wrap-width N that allows to choose the width
    of the error messages. If N is set to 0, the wrapping is disabled.
  - (experimental) added support for QBF (quantified boolean formula). It relies
    on Simon Cruanes' ocaml-qbf project, which relies on quantor and picosat.
  - added '\\' for spliting a long formula on two lines in latex view (inspired
    from latex language).
v3.1.0 (2017-05-11)
  - touist:
    - (experimental) an SMT solver is now available directly from the touist
      binary instead of a separate binary. This step took a LOT a work because
      the libyices library wasn't adapted to Windows building. I also had
      to publish ocamlyices2 to opam. To enable the SMT solver, you just
      have to do 'opam install yices2' followed by 'opam reinstall touist'.
v3.0.1 (2017-03-29)
  - touist:
    - fixed powerset([a,b]) that now correclty returns the empty set
v3.0.0 (2017-03-29)
  - touist:
    - (breaking change) the 'touistc' command-line binary is now named
      'touist' as it is not solely a compiler anymore (also plays the
      role of the solver)
    - (breaking change) command-line options have been normalized:
      1. -sat renamed to --sat and is enabled by default (if --smt is
         not given);
      2. -smt2 renamed to --smt
      3. -table is now --table
    - sets can now contain sets: [[a,b],[c,d]] is now correct
    - added the function 'powerset([a,b])' which computes a set of all
      subsets (including empty set) of [a,b].
    - added option --show that shows the formula after it has been
      evaluated (no more variables or bigands, only propositions, 'and',
      'or', '=>'...). Handy for debugging how your touistl has been
      translated.
v2.3.0 (2017-03-12)
  - touist:
    - it is now possible to generate sets using the following syntax:
      p(a,[1..2],[c]) will generate the set [p(a,1,c) p(a,2,c)]. It
      basically generates the cartesian product of the given sets.
      It can be really useful for creating time-related propositions
      indexed by numbers (time(1), time(2), time(3)...)
    - tuple-propositions of the form p(a,b,c) are now printed with no
      additional whitespaces. No more p(a, b, c).
    - fixed -smt2 so that it can handle +,-,/,* in formulas
    - fixed -smt2 so that variables in formulas can contain int and float
    - fixed --latex when propositions or variables contain '_'
    - enabled error coloring when touist is used in a terminal
    - the option --linter now does what --linter-expand is doing. The
      separation of both in the first place was due to the 'expand' being
      very expensive (because of the evaluations of bigand, bigor, exact,
      atleast, atmost and range sets). To make the 'expand' faster, I just
      'bypassed' these. As it is now duplicate, --linter-expand is removed.
v2.2.2 (2017-03-11)
  - touist:
    - added --latex option for transforming any touistl document into latex
    - when using --linter-expand, warnings are now displayed correctly
v2.2.1 (2017-03-11)
  - gui:
    - multiple errors can now be displayed, with a difference between warnings
      in blue and errors in red
  - touist:
    - a warning is given when using an empty set in bigand or bigor
v2.2.0 (2017-03-10)
  - gui:
    - when using one of the SMT selectors (QF_IDL...), the errors are now
      correctly linted (underlined in red)
  - touist:
    - global variables can now be affected anywhere (as long as it is not
      nested). The 'data' is still supported for compatibility but is not
      required anymore.
    - fixed '-smt2'; it had been broken for a long time
    - type checking has been moved from parse time to eval time. This means
      that less errors will (for now) appear automatically in the editor,
      and you will have to push 'Solve' to see the errors.
    - (internal) the grammar has been re-designed; I have to say, the previous
      parser (in v2.1.0) was broken: $i == 3.0 was always giving an error and
      3.0 == $i was not. I have to be honest: writing a parser is a pain.
      Along the way, I understood that having nasty reduce/reduce conflicts
      is a BAD idea. In this version, there is no more conflict!
    - (internal) added unit tests for the touist compiler, mainly to check
      that the parser accepts the right language and throws the right errors
    - the '--verbose' flag has been temporarily disabled (because of the code
      refactoring)
v2.1.4 (2017-03-06)
  - gui:
    - when clicking on the Solve button, it turns into 'Translating' as long
      as `touist` is translating, and then 'Solving' when the SAT solver is
      running. Also removed the alert message when stopping the solver.
    - on macOS, use system's menu bar look and feel
v2.1.3 (2017-03-03)
  - gui:
    - fixed a bug in the latex viwer that was removing the carriage return
      when a line was beginning with a '('.
    - ctrl+left and ctrl+right are now working properly for moving
      word by word in the text editor on Windows
v2.1.2 (2017-02-15)
  - touist:
    - abs() is now supported (absolute value)
v2.1.1 (2016-11-07)
  - gui:
    - fixed a bug that was preventing from ./external/touist to be run when
      the path contains whitespaces
v2.1.0 (2016-11-06)
  - gui: 
    - semantic errors (that only appear when pressing 'Solve' are now
      displayed) are now displayed like the syntaxic errors (still after
      'Solve')
  - touist:
    - it is now possible to do the affectations before the formulas, with
      no separator between sets and formulas. It is still possible to affect
      after formulas with the separation keyword 'data'. You can only affect
      before or after, not both.
    - semantic errors (e.g., variables with wrong type) are now giving
      a location (line, column). Some errors still lack the location but 99%
      of them are covered.
    - (internal) revamped the grammar specification to make it clear. The
      'simple' and 'smt-augmented' grammars are now well separated.
      Many error messages have been re-worked; among them, suggestions of
      operators when an expression continuation is expected.
      The number of messages goes from 89 to 144.
    - merged 'term' and 'tuple-term' into one single concept: the proposition.
      A proposition can be either 'abcd' or 'abcd(1,cd,56,$i)'.
v2.0.1 (2016-11-03)
  - gui:
    - fixed crash when touist.jar was opened from inside the zip archive
  - touist:
    - when dimacs and table both printing on stdout, the table now
      begins with 'c' to be able to pipe directly to a solver
    - added possibility of using a term in a 'when' or 'if' statement, e.g.,
      'bigand $i in [a,b,c] when $i != a: p($i) end
v2.0.0 (2016-11-01)
  - touist:
    - simplified 'begin sets end sets begin formula end formula'; syntax is
        <formulas> data <sets>
      Note that the sets are now after formulas. It will be soon possible
      to give the formulas and sets as two separate files, for genericity
      of the models (defined by the formulas) and the data (the sets).
   - fixed the problem of "Clause is always true/false" when bigand or
     bigor does not produce anything
   - added --linter for syntax errors and --linter-expand for syntax+
     semantic errors. The first is fast, the second is a bit slower.
   - added --verbose to have a sense of what is happening when the
     compiler is taking a long time to anwser.
  - gui:
    - now shows the errors in the editor we red-underlyings; you can
      see the error hovering the mouse over the error.
    - merged the sets and formulas tabs in GUI; the solution is now to
      use the syntax <formulas> data <sets>. I'm still looking for
      a way to separate formulas and sets in GUI, e.g., two separate
      files that have each its own tab
    - matching parenthesis are now hightlighted
    - when error message is too large, added 'click to view' message
    - linux: "solve" now works properly when touist.jar is opened by
      icon-clicking
v1.4.2 (2016-10-28)
    - (regression) possible to declare a set with terms: [a,b,c]...
v1.4.1 (2016-10-26)
    - (regression) output of the table (id,name) had been inverted (!)
v1.4.0 (2016-10-26)
  - touist:
    - touist is now able to solve SAT problems on its own. You can use
      '--solve' to return the first model of your problem, '--count' for
      counting the number of models), '--limit i' for setting a limit to
      the number of models returned (or 0 for no limit). Way faster that
      the java call to minisat.jar!
    - Added --equiv that allows to test the equivalency of two files.
      Note that it is not an actual equivalence as both problems must 
      have the exact same set of propositions/literals.
    - (internal) merged exp and clause types for less code redundancy
    - added support for local variables of the form 'let $i=1: p($i)'.
      A 'let' variable is local to the clause it precedes, e.g., p($i) 
  - gui:
    - added support for local variables of the form
      'let $i=1: p($i) end'. For now, the scope of these variables is
      not actually limited to the current context (the current clause);
      the variables exist even after 'end'.
v1.3.1 (2016-10-23)
  - touist:
    - fixed `a (b)` recognized as `a(b)` instead of `a and b`
    - added --debug-formula-expansion which prints the "expanded" version
      of bigand, bigor, exact and numerical expressions; helps for debugging
      complex formulas!
  - gui:
    - select the system language automatically
    - fix "export" button not working
    - export and import are now use the operating system UI (jre>=1.7)
    - jre>=1.7 is now required; it solves the wierd mac problem that says
      that you need to install the JDK for using command-line functions
v1.3.0 (2016-10-08)
  - touist.jar:
    - fix touist hanging on "solve" on some unsatisfiable formulas
    - fix subset(.,.) construct not displayed in latex display
  - touist:
    - now possible to have empty sets or formula block
    - added message when using a undeclared $var
    - added message when using a set instead of a term
    - added message when using a variable that doesn't have
      the expected content
    - revamped syntax errors, with multi-lines errors and precise position
      Note that many syntax errors still lack a proper message; some error
      messages still you can help us improve these messages in
      parser.messages file.
    - added <=> symbol that had been forgotten at some point
    - fixed bug with `not((p => p) => (q => q))` that should be
      unsat; it was related to CNF expansion happening in inner -> outer
      instead of outer -> inner
    - added --debug-cnf option for debugging cnf.ml transformations
    - added --debug-syntax option for debugging parser.messages messages
v1.2.0 (2016-10-03)
  - touist: select stdin with "-" and default output to stdout
  - touist: fixed bugs when translating to CNF; now handles correctly
    forms like `((p => q) and (q => r)) => r` and cleaned code.
v1.1.4 (2016-09-28)
  - fixed bug on expressions like (a=>b)=>c
v1.1.3 (2016-04-11)
  - added "View" menu item with zoom/unzoom latex viewer
  - ctrl-related shortcuts will now work with cmd on osx 

v1.1.2 (2016-04-03)
  - fix problem with whitespaces in path names (Victor David)
  - touist: In SMT mode, "Float" was produced instead of "Real" (Frédéric Maris)
  - touist: Now display a proper error when -smt2 is given with no logic    (Maël Valais)
  - gui: the left "snippets" panel has now a correct size (Maël Valais)
  - gui: more explicit error message when touist is missing (Maël Valais)

v1.1.1 (2016-03-23)
  - gui: dollars in variables are now displaying in bold font in latex (Maël Valais)
  - touist: the left panel with formulas should now be wide enough (Maël Valais)
  - gui: the _ characters won't trigger anymore small indices in latex (Maël Valais)
  - touist: fixed the exception given by touist when a variable has not been declared (Maël Valais)
  - workflow: added AppVeyor for the windows continuous integration (Maël Valais)
