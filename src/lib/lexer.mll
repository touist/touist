(* [token] is the function called by the parser for getting the next token.
   [token] returns a list of tokens instead of a single token, i.e., is of type
       (Lexing.lexbuf -> Parser.token list)                       (1)
   - Why: because of the case (ident as i)'(', we need to return two tokens;
     for example, with 'not(', we must return NOT and LPAREN.
   - Consequence: the parser cannot accept [token] directly; it needs a function
       (Lexing.lexbuf -> Parser.token)                            (2)
     This forces us to write another function ('lexer' in touist.ml) that
     transforms the function (1) to correct function type (2).
