# This AppVeyor configuration file has been writen to automate
# the building process and make deploying the application easy
# for the platform Windows.
#
# Like with the .travis.yml, this file will be executed
# by the appveyor servers and will build the project.
#
# 1. Why do I download this wodi32.zip instead of installing
#    ocaml-for-windows?
#    Actually it's because I couldn't make work the installer given on
#    protz.github.io/ocaml-installer/. The 64-bits version of the installer
#    doesn't seem to work properly and most importantly it pops up a window
#    that asks something to the user... which is impossible to deal in a CI env.
# 2. What is wodi32.zip and what does it contain?
#    It is a snapshot of the folder when I had wodi installed. Wodi has been
#    discontinued, this is why I had to make a "frozen in time" version.
#    It contains ocaml 4.02.1, fileutils, menhir and oasis.
#
# To allow AppVeyor knowing when things are pushed to the github repo,
# the owner of the repo had to link the repo in the AppVeyor website.

# I set the same behaviour as for in .travis.yml:

#
# I removed the notifications: block. I expect AppVeyor to have

# - If the commit fails, then send an email to the committer only.
# - If the commit previously failing now passes, do not send an email.
# - Do not send an email to anyone else
